      <h1>David M Krueger</h1>
        <h5>315 Sunset Drive West, Champlin, MN 55316 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 612 986-4532 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; dk12181@gmail.com</h5><br>
        <p>For the past 4 months I've been teaching myself coding in order to start a career in software programming. 
           During my time exploring options and languages available to me, I have found an immense amount of info at my fingertips. 
           This experience has made me realize that I need expertise and direction to help focus my independent learning. 
           Attending a boot camp at Prime Academy will refine my ability to learn programming languages and find a job as a programmer.</p>
